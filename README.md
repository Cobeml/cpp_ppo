# PPO Implementation in C++

A from-scratch implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in C++ without using any machine learning frameworks.

## Status: Core Implementation Complete, Architectural Issue Identified

### ✅ What Works
- **Complete Build System**: All components compile successfully
- **Neural Network Library**: Matrix operations, activation functions, dense layers
- **PPO Components**: Policy network, value network, experience buffer, and agent classes  
- **CartPole Environment**: Scalable physics simulation with 5 difficulty levels
- **Advanced ASCII Visualization**: Real-time training monitoring with progression tracking
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 33+ test functions covering all components

### ❌ Current Issue: Value Loss Dominance

The implementation suffers from a well-documented PPO architectural problem:

**Symptoms:**
- Value loss: 250-430 range (extremely high)
- Policy loss: Near zero (no meaningful learning)
- Performance plateau: 20-30 steps despite 1000+ episodes
- 0% success rate across all configurations

**Root Cause:** Shared parameter architecture creates fundamental conflict between policy and value function optimization.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make

# Run optimized training (shows the value loss issue)
./examples/optimized_ppo_training
```

## Current Training Results

```
Value Loss: 250-430 (target: <50)
Policy Loss: ~0.001 (no learning signal)
Episode Length: 20-30 steps (target: 150-200)
Success Rate: 0% (target: >80%)
```

## The Solution

See **[PPO_ARCHITECTURAL_SOLUTION_PLAN.md](PPO_ARCHITECTURAL_SOLUTION_PLAN.md)** for the comprehensive research-backed solution plan.

**Key Fix:** Separate neural networks for policy and value functions instead of shared parameters, plus additional architectural improvements.

## Usage Example

```cpp
#include "ppo/ppo_agent.hpp"
#include "environment/scalable_cartpole.hpp"
#include "utils/training_monitor.hpp"

int main() {
    ScalableCartPole env;
    PPOAgent agent(4, 2);  // 4 states, 2 actions
    TrainingMonitor monitor(100, 12, 200, true);
    
    // Training loop - currently shows value loss dominance
    for (int episode = 0; episode < 1000; ++episode) {
        // ... training code ...
        // Shows high value loss, minimal policy learning
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Separate Networks**: Split policy and value into independent neural networks
2. **Add Independent Optimizers**: Use separate Adam optimizers for each network  
3. **Enhanced Regularization**: Increase entropy coefficient and add gradient clipping
4. **Validation**: Test with CartPole environment
